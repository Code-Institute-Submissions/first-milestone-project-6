### Introduction
A front-end website has been created and has been designed to promote the American rock and pop band "The Monkees". Therein, you will find the latest news of a 2019 world tour that includes details of dates, venues and location of the bands’ live performance concerts. For the ultimate fan experience, there is an opportunity to book the band for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, etc. 
Fans can also access a discography that offers a full list of their albums, selection of audio tracks and a playable video promoting the latest ‘Good Times’ album that celebrates the bands existence over 5 decades.

### Prerequisite
This software has been designed to run on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera & Internet Explorer.

### Design

##### Colour palette used:
Inspiration of the choice of colours originated from the ‘Good Times’(2016) record album cover 

#C43232 Red

#6CB8AC Green

Background colour was selected upon review of The Monkees clothing. There are some instances where yellow was worn.  

#f7eed4 Yellow

Booking tickets section of ‘HeyHey!’ webpage continues theme of a 1970’s colour scheme with a touch of psychedelia thrown in for good measure.

#660066 Purple

#ffe6ff Lilac

Lower footer set to dark grey to clearly show copyright and web-designer information

#525252 dark  grey

#### UXD Considerations
The website design encourages both new and existing fans to access the band's critically acclaimed music, video and narrative.  50 years of performing is celebrated in the website through announcing a 2019 world tour and allowing fans to easily navigate to choose and select a concert that’s right for them. The ticket order process allows for the user to tailor their ticketing requirements, via secure password control.

Furthermore, fans can book an amazing personal experience to see the band live through completing a short, yet informative booking form.  

Imagery selected throughout the site design is biased towards what the band does best – having fun. 

The site has been created to ensure the user gets a non-complex, intuitive and enjoyable experience. It is hoped the fans feel closer to the band based upon the content therein. 

#### Wireframes
Balsamiq has been used to produce wireframe models. As I’m relatively inexperienced to web-design, I made a conscious decision to create mock up’s of the web-pages. This proved to be a master-stroke moment, as I could then secure a much improved physical visual design and apply my new found coding knowledge to this design.
I’ve included my .bmpr wireframe designs on GitHub.

The mock up design has evolved through the duration of my site build. The design changes were borne out of fully leveraging my coding skills coupled with upholding an effective UXD.

### Features

#### index.html
##### Feature 1
Alert message created to notify user of link to quickly access ticket sales and concert bookings. The alert only appears on the home page.

Navbar (repeated on all pages) has been designed to include a clickable icon image that is very synonymous with the bands brand. The user will always return to the home page with. In addition, the navbar allows the user to navigate to ‘music’, ‘heyhey!’ and ‘events & tickets’ pages. A ‘hamburger’ design has been built to collapse the navbar for Mobile devices.

A full black and white image of the band is on show from the header through to the first container ‘hot news!’. I was inspired by the design as a result of completing the bootstrap training and ‘Whisky Drop’ coding exercise. The thought of scrolling the image creates a sense of something next. 

‘Hot News!’ is central to the home page. Users are notified up front of important information concerning the band. In addition, there is a ‘Good Times’ text link that navigates the user to the ‘music’ page where a video has been added to talk further on ‘Good Times’ and further link to 50 year band celebrations.  Summary news of 2019 world tour is supported by use of glythicons, sourced from bootstrap / font awesome.

Further news of a 2019 world tour appears on home page via a ‘bootstrap’ table design. The design has been further modified to include a clickable button to allow user to check availability of tickets via a navigation link through to ‘events & tickets’ page. All buttons are subject to .hover pseudo class that provides a status colour change to the user when their cursor is placed upon the selected button.

Footer (repeated on all pages) includes social media links and fonts (glythicons) secured from bootstrap / font awesome. The links are wired to the bands’ respective social media sites. Again, the .hover pseudo class has been used to provide a background colour change (yellow to red) and font colour change too.  The lower footing allows for both copyright and web designer information.

### Technologies Used
##### HTML5 
HTML5 was used to create basic structure
##### CSS3 
Cascading Style Sheets provided support with formatting, positioning, coloring and styling
##### Bootstrap - https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/
Bootstrap 3.3.7 is used to create frameworks of a mobile-first design, it was used for navigation and page grid layout in the website.
##### JQuery - https://jquery.com/
JQuery is added to the site to assist the implementation of JavaScript and Bootstrap.
##### Google Fonts - https://fonts.google.com/
Google fonts are used to create an impact to the web-design and uphold a styling theme.
•	'Bangers, cursive': Used for headings.
•	'Boogaloo, cursive': Used for the form, page paragraphs and buttons
##### Font Awesome - https://www.bootstrapcdn.com/fontawesome/
Font Awesome is used to add social links font (images) to the website. These fonts were Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Spotify.
##### Git & GitHub - https://github.com/
Git is used as a command line tool to support version control, through moving files to a staging area prior to adding to a local repository. For safe storage and to allow other users to view my deployed website, all relevant files were then pushed from Git to GitHub.
