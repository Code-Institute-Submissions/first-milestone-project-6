### Introduction
A front-end website has been created and has been designed to promote the American rock and pop band "The Monkees". Therein, you will find the latest news of a 2019 world tour that includes details of dates, venues and location of the bands’ live performance concerts. For the ultimate fan experience, there is an opportunity to book the band for weddings, anniversaries, birthdays, etc. 
Fans can also access a discography that offers a full list of their albums, selection of audio tracks and a playable video promoting the latest ‘Good Times’ album that celebrates the bands existence over 5 decades.

### Prerequisite
This software has been designed to run on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Opera & Internet Explorer.

### Design

##### Colour palette used:
Inspiration of the choice of colours originated from the ‘Good Times’(2016) record album cover 

#C43232 Red

#6CB8AC Green

Background colour was selected upon review of The Monkees clothing. There are some instances where yellow was worn.  

#f7eed4 Yellow

Booking tickets section of ‘HeyHey!’ webpage continues theme of a 1970’s colour scheme with a touch of psychedelia thrown in for good measure.

#660066 Purple

#ffe6ff Lilac

Lower footer set to dark grey to clearly show copyright and web-designer information

#525252 dark  grey

#### UXD Considerations
The website design encourages both new and existing fans to access the band's critically acclaimed music, video and narrative.  50 years of performing is celebrated in the website through announcing a 2019 world tour and allowing fans to easily navigate to choose and select a concert that’s right for them. The ticket order process allows for the user to tailor their ticketing requirements, via secure password control.

Furthermore, fans can book an amazing personal experience to see the band live through completing a short, yet informative booking form.  

Imagery selected throughout the site design is biased towards what the band does best – having fun. 

The site has been created to ensure the user gets a non-complex, intuitive and enjoyable experience. It is hoped the fans feel closer to the band based upon the content therein. 

#### Wireframes
Balsamiq has been used to produce wireframe models. As I’m relatively inexperienced to web-design, I made a conscious decision to create mock up’s of the web-pages. This proved to be a master-stroke moment, as I could then secure a much improved physical visual design and apply my new found coding knowledge to this design.
I’ve included my .bmpr wireframe designs on GitHub.

The mock up design has evolved through the duration of my site build. The design changes were borne out of fully leveraging my coding skills coupled with upholding an effective UXD.
