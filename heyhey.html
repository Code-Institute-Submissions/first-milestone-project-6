                       <p>The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed.
                       They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the American television series The Monkees, which aired 
                       from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and the English actor and 
                       singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart. </p> 
                       <div class="block-divider--back-story"></div>
                       <p>The four actor-musicians were initially allowed only limited roles in the recording studio for the first few months of their five-year career as
                       "the Monkees". This was due in part to the amount of time required to film the television series. Nonetheless, Nesmith did compose and produce some
                       songs from the beginning, and Peter Tork contributed limited guitar work on the sessions produced by Nesmith. They eventually fought for the right
                       to collectively supervise all musical output under the band's name. The television show was cancelled in 1968 but the band continued to record music
                       through 1971. </p>
                       <div class="block-divider--back-story"></div>
                       <p>A revival of interest in the television show came in 1986, which led to a series of reunion tours and new records. The group has reunited and
                       toured several times since then with different line-ups and varying degrees of success. After Jones died in February 2012, the surviving members
                       reunited for a tour in November–December 2012 and again in 2013 for a 24-date tour. The Monkees continued to tour through their 2016 50th anniversary
                       , with Dolenz and Tork forming the core of the band and Nesmith continuing to join them occasionally. </p>
